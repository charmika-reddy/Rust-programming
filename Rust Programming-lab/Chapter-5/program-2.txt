//Write a program to Calculate Distance Between Two Points:
a. A struct Point is given which has two items, x and y.
b. The function test is given which has two instances of points initialised with some
value of x and y.
c. The task is to calculate the distance between the two points.
d. The distance between two points is:
e. Return the value of distance


use std::f64;

struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn distance(a: &Point, b: &Point) -> f64 {
    ((b.x - a.x).powi(2) + (b.y - a.y).powi(2)).sqrt()
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 3.0, y: 4.0 };
    let p2 = Point { x: 7.0, y: 1.0 };

    println!("Distance = {}", distance(&p1, &p2));
