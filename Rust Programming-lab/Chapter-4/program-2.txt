//2. Write a function test_divisibility_by_3_4 which will check whether a given integer 
number is divisible by 3 or 4. 
a. If the number is divisible by both return 0 
b. If the number is divisible by 3 only return 1 
c. If the number is divisible by 4 only return 2 
d. If the number is not divisible by both, return -1
